Zoom by errnio enhances the mobile zoom experience on any image on your wordpress site, offering better zoom, sharing, and image discovery.  

== Description ==

**Zoom by errnio** adds an enhanced zoom experience to your site by giving visitors on mobile the option to zoom into any image on your site, without harming your mobile experience. The errnio zoom plugin also adds engagement layer to any image, offering a slide gallery and set of social sharing options to any image, once the user zooms in. 


The plugin offers a small zoom icon on the bottom right of your images as a hint. Once the user performs a zooming finger gesture, taps an image, or pinches it, the image is isolated for optimal zoom. In this mode, additional options are offered, enabling the swiping of other images on the article, and social share buttons. 


This tool enhances user experience, engaging your visitors with your content on mobile. errnio can increase your pages per visit, time spent on site, and improve your over site engagement on mobile.
